Gathers demos of several libraries or frameworks.

## Local development environment setup

I develop on macOS ARM builds, so scripts and setup files target Unix-based platforms.

I use the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE.

I use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to set up my local environment.

Environment variables and tool versions defined via `mise` are visible in my IDE when I launch it from the directory
containing the `mise.toml` file (I had installed IntelliJ IDEA via the JetBrains Toolbox application). The mise
documentation provides several ways to achieve [IDE integration](https://mise.jdx.dev/ide-integration.html).
